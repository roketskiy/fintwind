# Waku

Waku is a fast, native macOS control plane for local coding agents. It is built
in Rust with [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui)
and keeps projects, sessions, transcripts, and provider IDs on the local
machine.

The first MVP supports:

| Provider | Transport | Session continuity | Checkpoint rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `stream-json` | Native Claude session cursor | Not exposed by this transport |
| Codex CLI | `app-server` JSON-RPC | `thread/start` and `thread/resume` | `thread/rollback` |
| OpenCode | Native JSON events | Native OpenCode session cursor | Not exposed by this transport |
| Grok Build | Native `streaming-json` | Native Grok session cursor | Not exposed by this transport |

Each provider is connected through its strongest structured interface and
translated into Waku's small, provider-neutral event model. Grok uses its
ordered headless NDJSON stream rather than ACP.

## Product reference

[T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) is Waku's primary product
reference for coding-agent workflows, information hierarchy, tool activity,
and transcript presentation. Before changing user-visible behavior, inspect
the same flow in the current T3 Code app or source rather than relying on an
older screenshot or recollection.

T3 Code is reference evidence, not a requirement to copy web-specific details
or existing bugs. Waku should preserve the intent of the reference while using
native macOS interaction conventions and provider-native structured data.
Explicit user screenshots and feedback are the acceptance criteria when they
conflict with a prior treatment.

## Run

Requirements:

- macOS
- Rust 1.96 or newer
- At least one supported agent CLI available in `PATH` or a common local
  install directory

For development, run:

```sh
scripts/dev.sh
```

This builds and signs `target/debug/Waku Debug.app`, launches the bundled
executable, and watches Rust sources, embedded assets, resources, and Cargo
manifests. After a successful rebuild it restarts the app automatically. A
failed build leaves the last working app open. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the
watcher and app.

Debug builds use the app name `Waku Debug`, bundle identifier `codes.waku.dev`,
and their own `Waku Debug/state.json` local data directory. Release builds use
`Waku`, bundle identifier `codes.waku`, and `Waku/state.json`, so both apps can
be installed and used without sharing state.

Running `cargo run` directly is useful for quick terminal debugging, but it
launches a bare executable without the macOS app-bundle identity used by
accessibility tools.

Waku detects `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, and `grok` at launch. Existing CLI
authentication and configuration remain owned by each provider.

To produce a native app bundle:

```sh
scripts/bundle.sh release
open target/release/Waku.app
```

### Production DMG

The Bun TypeScript packager builds the release executable, assembles and signs
`Waku.app`, uses [`create-dmg`](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg) for
the Finder layout and Applications drop target, submits the result for
notarization, and staples the accepted ticket:

```sh
brew install create-dmg
xcrun notarytool store-credentials NOTARY

bun scripts/package-dmg.ts
```

The packager selects the Developer ID identity matching team `GJE9R5VE87` and
the `NOTARY` keychain profile by default. The default artifact is
`dist/Waku-<version>.dmg`. Use an ad-hoc signature to exercise the complete
local build and disk-image flow without Apple distribution credentials:

```sh
bun scripts/package-dmg.ts --adhoc
```

Run `bun scripts/package-dmg.ts --help` for output, version, build-number, and
notarization options.

## Interaction model

- Add local project folders from the sidebar.
- Start independent sessions with `⌘N`.
- Search and select a provider model before the first message; its reasoning
  effort and service tier are remembered for new tasks too, and favorite models
  stay available in the picker.
- Tune provider-advertised reasoning effort and speed from one compact model
  traits menu.
- Choose Supervised, Auto-accept edits, Auto, or Full access independently from
  the Build/Plan interaction mode.
- Stop the active turn with `Escape`.
- In a Git project, revert a completed Codex turn from its checkpoint action.
- Toggle the sidebar with `⌘⇧S` and focus the composer with `⌘L`.

State is written atomically to the profile-specific platform-local application
data directory described above. No telemetry or remote Waku service is involved.

## Architecture

`src/driver/` contains provider-specific transports. They emit normalized
`DriverEvent` values for connection state, streamed text, reasoning, tool
activity, permissions, completion, and errors. `src/app.rs` owns the GPUI view
state and never parses a provider wire format.

The MVP keeps the Codex transport alive for a session. Claude Code, OpenCode,
and Grok use resumable per-turn processes, preserving their native session IDs.
The next product layer is richer provider-native configuration: structured
diffs, file attachments, and OpenCode's managed server API.

### Sessions and checkpoints

Waku follows [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code)'s
split-responsibility design: Waku's own state is the canonical UI timeline,
while each task also stores a typed provider resume cursor (`threadId`,
`sessionId`, and provider-specific extensions). Resuming a task starts or
reconnects the provider transport with that cursor; Waku does not reconstruct
the provider conversation by replaying transcript text.

Every submitted prompt creates a durable turn record. In Git projects, Waku
captures the full working tree in an isolated temporary index and stores the
snapshot under a hidden ref:

```text
refs/waku/session-<session-id>-turn-<turn-number>
```

Reverting restores that ref, asks the provider to roll back the same number of
native turns, then truncates Waku's turn-owned messages and activity blocks.
Before any restore, Waku creates a temporary safety ref; if provider rollback
fails, it restores the original working tree and leaves the local timeline
unchanged. The revert action is capability-gated, so providers whose current
transport cannot roll back native conversation state never offer a
filesystem-only revert.

## Verify

```sh
cargo fmt --package waku -- --check
cargo check
cargo test
```
