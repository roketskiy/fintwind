# Waku

Waku is a fast, native desktop app for working with local coding agents. It is
built in Rust with [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui)
and keeps projects, sessions, transcripts, and provider IDs on your machine.

[Download Waku for macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://waku.sh/#download)

## Supported agents

Waku works with:

- [Amp](https://ampcode.com/)
- Claude Code
- Codex CLI
- Cursor CLI
- Grok Build
- OpenCode
- Pi

Install and authenticate at least one supported agent CLI before starting Waku.
Waku detects available CLIs automatically and uses each provider's native
structured protocol and session continuity.

## Highlights

- Keep projects and independent agent sessions in one native app.
- Switch models, reasoning effort, and access modes from a shared interface.
- Queue or steer follow-up messages while an agent is working.
- Rewind Git-backed tasks with conversation-aware checkpoints.
- Store app state locally, with no Waku account or remote service required.

## Development

Development currently requires macOS, [Rust 1.96 or newer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
