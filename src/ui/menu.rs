//! Context menus and dropdown menus.
//!
//! Both share one card and one dismissal model; they differ only in where they
//! anchor — a context menu at the pointer, a dropdown under its trigger.
//!
//! A menu is built lazily: the item list is only constructed once the menu
//! actually opens, and while closed the wrapper contributes one `Rc<Cell>` read
//! and no children. The open menu renders through `deferred(anchored(..))` so it
//! escapes its row's clipping and paints above every sibling.
//!
//! Dismissal follows Zed's own context menus:
//!
//! - **Click outside** uses `on_mouse_down_out`, which tests the card's own
//!   hitbox during the capture phase. An occluding full-window backdrop would
//!   also work but has to guess the window size and swallows hover elsewhere.
//!   A left click on the trigger is exempt — capture runs before the trigger's
//!   bubble-phase toggle, so closing here would make the toggle see a closed
//!   menu and reopen it.
//! - **Escape** is an action bound in the menu's own key context, so it beats
//!   the transcript's `escape` binding instead of also cancelling the turn.
//! - **Focus** is taken two frames after opening. Deferred elements are not
//!   linked into the dispatch tree until after the deferred draw runs, so
//!   focusing any earlier silently does nothing — and then no key reaches the
//!   menu at all.
